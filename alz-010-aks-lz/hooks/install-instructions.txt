# What is pre-commit?
Pre-commit has been configured to run terraform format, validate and tflint before every commit.
This shifts testing left enabling issues with those items to be picked up locally, rather than the pipeline failing.

# How do I install?

Option 1:
- Manually copy pre-commit & pre-commit.ps1 to .git/hooks
